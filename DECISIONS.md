## 2026-07-03 — Grilling 0: foundational architecture stances (#145)

> Detalhe (ADR-lite, pt-BR): `docs/planning/decisions.md` D-015–D-018. Avaliação de runtime: `docs/planning/explore/runtime-serverless-vs-persistent.md`.

### Build vs buy default

**Decision:** Managed/SaaS by default; no self-hosting; no owner-facing back-office admin (use vendor dashboards). Custom code only for the unique flows (visits/identity, corretor).

**Rationale:** Solo dev, free-first, zero-ops — the scarce resource is developer time, not money within free/cheap tiers. Reject self-hosting and bespoke admin as time sinks with no customer value.

**Implications:**
- Every stack choice passes the buy-first filter.
- Vendor dashboards (e.g. Supabase Studio) are the permanent back-office.

### Content placement — CMS + Supabase (resolves Q-004)

**Decision:** Content (house listings, blog, timeline, media) → CMS (Contentful/Sanity). Operational state + sensitive PII (status, leads, visits, verification, Gov.br contracts, RG/CNH) → Supabase (Postgres + private RLS bucket). Video → YouTube/Vimeo embed. Social → outside the platform. Join by shared house ID.

**Rationale:** "CMS vs DB" is a false binary; the house has both operational/relational data and content/media. A managed CMS gives authoring UX with zero build; Supabase owns operational truth + PII. The content↔operational boundary is a thin reference by ID, not heavy sync, at this scale. Rejected: Supabase-only (weak authoring), self-hosted Directus (violates zero-ops), dropping Contentful entirely (reversed).

**Implications:**
- CMS vendor reversible via a service layer; decided at build.
- Pre-resolves the storage side of Q-005/Q-016.

### System shape — serverless

**Decision:** Serverless Nuxt/Nitro on Vercel (Hobby → Pro when useful), API-first, Upstash QStash for delayed/retried async, integration-adapter seam, Telegram-first messaging, Nitro-portable. Persistent-process alternative evaluated and rejected for now.

**Rationale:** Priorities free-first + zero-ops + Vercel simplicity point at serverless; no free always-on host gives both no-sleep and no-ops. Traded away: async coherence (scattered across functions + QStash), accepted by the owner. At 1–2 houses/year, usage never triggers a paid upgrade.

**Implications:**
- Live video offloaded to vendors (not proxied by the backend).
- Portability kept as cheap insurance against future host constraints.

### MVP boundary — v1/v2/v3

**Decision:** v1 = public site + portfólio + WhatsApp visit CTA + auth/roles + corretor portal (onboarding, lead + first-wins commission timestamp, HubSpot) with Gov.br manual-first. Tours (booked + QR) + identity + Tuya + calendar → v2. Media kit / social / cliente portal / BI → v3. Architect v1 deep; defer v2/v3 detail behind a "lock-now" list (core data model + IDs, RBAC for all roles, storage taxonomy, adapter seam, API-first, QStash).

**Rationale:** Full scope is many months for a solo dev. Corretor before tours: no hardware/external deps, protects commission early, human-sales-aligned. Tours = largest/riskiest unique build → v2. Gov.br manual-first so it doesn't gate shipping. Rejects big-design-up-front (D-011) and blind deferral (would foreclose v2/v3).

**Implications:**
- v2/v3 architecture decided just-in-time at each phase's grilling.
- #28 (standalone Q-004 grilling) subsumed by #145.

## 2026-07-10 — Environment tiers (#147 / A1)

### Three logical environments — local / staging / prod

**Decision:** Exactly three logical environments. Preview deploys are a delivery mechanism, not a fourth name. `local` = isolated laptop (Nuxt/Node + local DB/mocks). `staging` = private pre-prod (dev + optional partner UAT). `prod` = live. Data outside prod is seed/fake by default (no prod PII copy). Integrations: mock / safe-target / prod-live — never a real door or real-customer WhatsApp off prod. Promote via staging before prod; emergency hotfixes are exceptional, explicit, and logged (procedure later). Runtime identity: `APP_ENV`.

**Rationale:** Minimum set that separates disposable work, shared validation, and real customers without multiplying free-tier accounts for a solo free-first setup. Spec only in this step — delivery (branches, hosting, domains, seed packs) comes in later leaves.

**Implications:**
- Canon: `docs/planning/decisions.md` D-025; template `docs/planning/templates/environments.md`; sócios page `docs/planning/ambientes.html`.
- Unblocks branch mapping, Vercel topology, and domains leaves with a shared vocabulary.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Branch → environment map (#148 / A2)

### Git lines map to local / staging / prod

**Decision:** Long-lived `staging` + `main` (prod) + short-lived `feat/*` and `fix/*` (Preview → staging-class backends). Normal path: feature → merge to `staging` → separate promote to `main`. Close targets the integration branch (`staging` for ForteGB); promote is not automatic in Vercel. Global close skill stays agnostic: default merge-to-`main`; optional repo config `integrationBranch` (implemented later in #166). Until then, docs/skill may disagree — gap called out in STATUS.

**Rationale:** Keeps the three-environment contract honest in git without hardcoding ForteGB into a multi-product skill.

**Implications:**
- Canon: D-026; template branches section; Ambientes page updated.
- #166 DoD: read opt-in config; ForteGB adds the file.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Vercel topology (#149 / A3)

### One project · Production vs Preview · password gate

**Decision:** Single Vercel project. Production tracks `main` only. `staging` and feature branches deploy as Previews (coexist with Production; cold start ≠ powering off prod). Previews use shared-password host protection (no Vercel account for partners; one unlock per browser). App auth remains a separate layer. Env: Production scope = prod; Preview scope = staging-class for all Previews.

**Rationale:** Matches the branch map with minimal ops; keeps staging private without onboarding sócios to Vercel.

**Implications:**
- Canon: D-027; template + Ambientes page. Domains → #150. Project not provisioned in this change.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Passos 1–2 validated (#177)

### Contexto & Funcionalidades closed by grilling (journeys stay in step 5)

**Decision:** Passos 1–2 are validated. Canonical artifacts accepted (`company-structure.md`, `platform-vision.md`, `deliverables.md`, `modules.md`). No new offer items. Deep journey/screen re-validation remains passo 5 (#176). Planning hygiene must not contradict known board/org/Architecture state.

**Rationale:** Content was already sufficient; a leafless epic needed a real DoD (decision + hygiene), not invented product scope.

**Implications:**
- Canon: `docs/planning/decisions.md` D-028.
- Closes #177; enables closing epic #175. G2 still gates build until Definição 4–7 close.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Domains per environment (#150 / A4)

### Hostnames for local / staging / preview / prod + .com.br redirects

**Decision:** Prod = `fortegb.com` + `www.fortegb.com` (same Production). Stable staging = `staging.fortegb.com`. Feature Previews = `*.vercel.app` only. Local = localhost. `fortegb.com.br` / `www.fortegb.com.br` = 301 → `https://fortegb.com` (not app hosts; no staging `.com.br`). Platform docs stay on GitHub Pages.

**Rationale:** One staging bookmark; ephemeral PR URLs; `.com` canonical; `.com.br` via HTTP redirect at registrar/CDN.

**Implications:**
- Canon: D-029; template + Ambientes page. DNS/Vercel attach not done in this change. Next data leaf: #151.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Supabase projects per environment (#151 / B1)

### Two cloud projects + local Docker; Previews share staging

**Decision:** Cloud projects `fortegb-staging` and `fortegb-prod` only. Local = Docker/OrbStack (CLI), not a third cloud project. All Vercel Previews use staging. No prod PII in non-prod by default. One schema-as-code across targets. Auth redirects and Vercel Production/Preview secret scopes map to those projects. Free-tier: 2 active projects; ~7d pause caveat; storage caps known.

**Rationale:** Matches Free plan; Previews already staging-class (D-027); local doesn’t burn a cloud slot.

**Implications:**
- Canon: D-030; template + Ambientes page. Projects/secrets not provisioned in this change. Seed → #154.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Supabase CLI migration strategy (#152 / B2)

### Migrations in repo; CLI apply; not on Vercel deploy

**Decision:** Schema source of truth = `supabase/migrations/` via Supabase CLI. Apply local against Docker; staging/prod via CLI `db push` (staging before prod). No auto-migrate on Vercel. Forward-only; seed separate (#154); RLS in migrations. `docs/database-schema.sql` = legacy until ported. Optional thin npm wrappers later — no custom migrator.

**Rationale:** Matches Supabase local/cloud; keeps deploys from mutating schema by surprise.

**Implications:**
- Canon: D-031; template + Ambientes. Local runbook → #153 / D-032. Init/scaffold → #171 / #43.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Local Supabase runbook (#153 / B3)

### OrbStack preferred; docs-only; init deferred

**Decision:** Document local Supabase day-to-day: OrbStack preferred on macOS (Docker Desktop OK); install CLI; start/stop/status; Studio + keys → `.env`; `db reset`; common failures. **No** `supabase init` / `supabase/` scaffold in this leaf — that belongs to bootstrap (#171) and/or schema build (#43). Toolchain inventory stays #170; seed #154; cloud push remains D-031.

**Rationale:** Closes the operational gap without mixing repo scaffold into definition docs; keeps #153 focused vs #170/#171.

**Implications:**
- Canon: D-032; `templates/supabase-local.md` + Ambientes pointer. Next dados leaf: #154 seed.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Seed / test data + LGPD non-prod (#154 / B4)

### Shared synthetic pack; dummy docs; test logins; recreatable

**Decision:** One base seed pack for local+staging (not prod). Supabase operational rows + stable house IDs; CMS fixtures later (#156/#157). Realistic pt-BR synthetic people; dummy RG/CNH repo fixtures → local/staging storage only. Known corretor+staff test auth accounts (non-prod). Disposable and one-command recreatable. No prod dumps. Full LGPD hardening → #126. Docs only in this leaf (`templates/seed-lgpd.md`).

**Rationale:** Safe UAT and ID-verification testing without real customer PII.

**Implications:**
- Canon: D-033. Implement seed files after supabase scaffold. Next epic leaf: #155 CMS vendor.

---

## 2026-07-10 — CMS vendor: Sanity (#155 / C1)

### Sanity chosen; Contentful removed from installed stack

**Decision:** CMS vendor = **Sanity**. Free-tier longevity, 2 datasets for staging/prod, schema-as-code, avoid Contentful pricing cliff. Remove `contentful` dependency; `useCms` composable (mocks until provisioned). Retitle build issues #45/#63. Datasets → #156; content model → #157.

**Rationale:** Matches D-015 free-first and ForteGB scale.

**Implications:**
- Canon: D-034. D-016 taxonomy unchanged (CMS + Supabase). Living docs/code no longer point at Contentful as the stack.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Sanity datasets per environment (#156 / C2)

### Two datasets; Previews share staging; explicit promote

**Decision:** One Sanity project; datasets `staging` + `production`. Local + staging + all Vercel Previews → `staging`; prod → `production`. Promote content with explicit CLI/copy — not on Vercel deploy. Preview env → staging dataset; Production → production; local → staging or mocks. Exact var names → #162+. Content model → #157.

**Rationale:** Mirrors Supabase/Vercel staging-class sharing; fits free tier; prevents deploy from publishing draft content.

**Implications:**
- Canon: D-035; template + Ambientes. No Sanity project created in this change. Next: #157 content model.

---

## 2026-07-10 — CMS content model (#157)

### Document types + house CMS/Supabase split

**Decision:** Sanity types `house`, `blogPost`, `constructionTimeline`, `mediaKit`. v1 full depth on house + blogPost; timeline/mediaKit stub for later (D-018). Sanity holds marketing + `houseId`; Supabase holds ops (status, Tuya, QR). Nuxt merges by `houseId`. Video = YouTube/Vimeo URLs. Locale = pt-BR only. This leaf = docs only; Studio schemas → #45.

**Rationale:** Keeps PII/ops out of CMS; shared contract for Studio and portfolio without over-modeling v3 modules in Architecture.

**Implications:**
- Canon: D-036; `templates/cms-content-model.md` + Ambientes. Next Architecture leaf: #158 integrations 3-tier model.
